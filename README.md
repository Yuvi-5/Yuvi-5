"Every line of code, every AI model, and every firewall I build exists to protect and accelerate one promise: Correct. Complete. And On-Time."

👨‍💻 About Me

I am a production-focused Computer Science graduate (Algoma University, 4.0 GPA) specializing in Deep Reinforcement Learning, Zero Trust Cybersecurity architectures, and Industrial IoT pipelines. I build resilient, margin-focused technology that eliminates bottlenecks across supply chains and operational environments.

🔭 Currently building: Context-aware AI reconciliation pipelines at Raventrack Construction & Heavy Industry AI.

🏢 Co-Founder: Architecting serverless, PIPEDA-compliant OCR infrastructure at Ordino Fintech.

📖 Published Author: Co-authored "HyDRO-DDQN" (IEEE MVDA 2025), optimizing edge-cloud offloading via Deep Q-Networks.

🌱 Currently expanding research in: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) task models, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and RNNs for energy reduction in multi-edge environments.

👨‍🏫 Teaching Assistant: Master's Level Introduction to Cybersecurity & Core CS Fundamentals.
